### Building Site using Minimal Computing.


  
Over the past few days i have learnt some of the basics on how to begin to construct a digital site using Minimal Computing which would be beneficial to my University.  

 At my university we have started to digitized some of our collections however we were not able to have them on a platform where they can be displayed to our patrons.   

 I Am hoping that after completing the activities of this week i would be able to do so. During my time here i have met and talk with some wonderful folks who shows a great deal of interest of what is being taught to us.  
 
 Our instructors are great which makes this course fun and encouraging  I am looking forward to the future where i can have similar programs like these which can further enhance my skills.
